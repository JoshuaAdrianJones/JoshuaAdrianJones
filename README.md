## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joshua, I'm a fully remote tech worker based in the UK

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

I've made the transition to tech over the last 2 years - I currently guide a team working on data capture (complex surveys) and data analysis products for the market research industry. 

I write internal tools in Python and Pandas, and support our clients in fast-paced, short-lived projects.

Most recently my side project is a data analysis tool; I've been the sole contributor to a ~3Kloc Python codebase where I have implemented clean architecture, SOLID design principles, and continuous refactoring to keep the app in great shape and ensure it's easy to add new features in the future.

The core is object orientated, loosely coupled Python, and the interface is a PyQT GUI bundled to `.exe` using pyinstaller.

#### My day job includes:
- Strategic planning and new product take to market planning
- Building MVP's
- Recruiting and hiring
- Onboarding, training, and mentoring
- Business development
- Team leadership and managing multiple projects
- Working with CxO level internally and externally

...And of course writing lots of code!
